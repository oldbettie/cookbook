# About

Project Cookbook for sei-52 is the second project of the course we utilize what we have learnt to build a fully functioning CRUD web application.
I chose to build a cookbook to one day sell to instagram for millions of dollers. When people want to post pictures of their food they can dirrectly post to my app that will give them a list of ingredients and directions on how to cook it amongst other useful information. You can also find recipes to try yourself.

This will stop food showing up on my instagram making me hungry all the time.

# Updates

April 14th 2022:
integrated a search feature aswell as options when uploading recipes to set search parameters such as food category and regions ect. this will allow for people to search for things like "thai breakfast" without explicitly having to say that it is thai or breakfast in the decscription/instructions. also implemented image uploads just for user profile to allow people to set an image for their account. recipe images currently still require hotlinking just to show both code examples.

some mobile optimization has been done but it varies from screen size i did this as a self learning experience we have not covered this topic yet but i learnt building for mobile first is the best approach.

# Tools and Implementation

This project was built with ruby on rails as the main tool. but also utizes SCSS, HTML.ERB, as well as a few handy gems Cloudinary for image uploads and Ransack for search functionality. all css was done manually.

-   Ruby on Rails 5.2.7

# TODO

Category sub menus can be implemented at any point
Further mobile optimizations

# KOOL FEATURES

-   light/dark mode toggle in account sub heading.
-   like button.
-   search feature.

# Bugs

may still be some bugs if you find any let me know and il check it out.

im aware of the poor mobile optimizations.
